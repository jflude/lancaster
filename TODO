- Change the socket code and program options to support IPv6 addresses
- README should begin with an overview of the Lancaster system & ideas
- Simpler READER & WRITER example programs using the batch functions
- Define DEBUG_ALLOC for a doubly-linked list of allocations; dump at_exit(3)
- Convert DEBUG_ build options into checks on an environment variable?
- Free store allocation of properties within the segment, growing down
- Document pubmux & submux; maybe modernize Go build/deps tracking?
- Provide a Common Lisp client library (CFFI)
- Modernize the Go client library (fix deps/vendor/build)
- Persuade Peak6 to contribute their Java & Python client libraries?
- Support send/receive by point-to-point UDP as well as multicasting?

## Protocol changes

- Receivers may inform senders via TCP if uninterested in a range of records
- Senders may not multicast updates for records if no receivers are interested
